- ⚽️ I love football (YNWA), obscure facts about science (see: Physics nerd), and sampling beer & wine with my partner.

This will be a central place where I promote things I've been working on. 
Some projects will be follow-along tutorials while I get up to speed, others will be any random ideas that pop into my head!
Enjoy!
